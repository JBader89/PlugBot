# sockjs-client-node [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/3rd-Eden/sockjs-client-node.png)](https://travis-ci.org/3rd-Eden/sockjs-client-node)

This a small wrapper around the `sockjs-client` framework that was designed for
browsers. It wraps it in to a `jsdom` environment and adds some `WebSocket`
magic to make it go fast.

#### Installation

```
npm install sockjs-client-node
```

#### API

```js
var SockJS = require('sockjs-client-node');

//
// The API is exactly the same as the regular sockjs client.
//
```
